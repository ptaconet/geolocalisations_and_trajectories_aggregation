These data come from FADS database and are collected by French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD). FADS database gathers the fine data from french surface tuna fisheries and partners. This database contains data about FADS location. The location are classified according to RandomForest method and each location is predict at sea or on boat. The processing uses only fishing activities.  The processing attributes each geolocation to an unique polygon. If the location is between several polygons then the polygon is choice randomly.Concerning calendar, time_start and time_end are inclusive.

                    step3: A regular grid composed of square polygons was created. The spatial extent is lon: -100 -45  lat: 115 50 with a resolution of 5 decimal degrees.
                    step4: A continius calendar was created from 2006-11-01 to 2015-12-31 with a period of 1 month(s) . The time start and time end are inclusive.
                    step5: Each fishing data was associated to one polygon using the data geolocalisation.
